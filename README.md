# Fake Image Detection System


## Introduction

In today's digital age, the spread of fake or manipulated images is a significant concern. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it increasingly challenging to detect fake images due to their ability to generate highly convincing visuals. This project aims to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system that can distinguish between genuine and AI-generated images.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```shell
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Aditya1Adi/fake-image-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd fake-image-detection
```

3. Place your real and fake image datasets in the appropriate folders (`real_images/` and `fake_images/`).

## Usage

### Training

To train the fake image detection model, run the following command:

```shell
python train.py
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, run the following command:

```shell
python evaluate.py
```

### Inference

To make predictions on a new image, run the following command:

```shell
python predict.py --image <image_path>
```

Replace `<image_path>` with the path to the image you want to classify.
